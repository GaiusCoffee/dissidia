## Welcome to the Dissidia Tabletop RPG

The Dissidia Tabletop RPG is a Pen and Paper roleplaying game that is inspired by [Square Enix's Final Fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_%28video_game%29) series as well as [Returner Games' FFRPG](http://ffrpg.net/ffrpg). Dissidia is designed from the groud up to be minimal and modular, as well as a [Minmaxer's Delight](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinmaxersDelight).
  
This rulebook is divided into crystal shards, with chapters that is usually summarized in one or two paragraphs, with a more detailed explanation afterwards. Only the Core Shard, the Steel Shard, the Black Shard and the Shards that your Players choose to follow are required to play the game, besides some dice, pen/pencils and some paper.
